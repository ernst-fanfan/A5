Following the test programs above, write a new test program called
RemoveDuplicates.java. The program reads text input from keyboard or a text file
and adds the words to a BST. The program then traverses the BST and prints out the
words in order on the screen (or to output text file). Note that you may need to
make some changes to BST.java.
